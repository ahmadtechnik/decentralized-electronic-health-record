# decentralized-electronic-health-record
A decentralized electronic health record. Get ahead of the virus by tracking symptoms, geolocation and social connections while protecting patient privacy.

## Goal:
The goal is to build a decentralized EHR that looks for symptoms of COVID-19 and helps with reducing the transmission rate.

## IPR- Initial Public Release
There will be three features
1) Symptom tracker that follows a specific medical protocol. 
Help needed from medical professionals.

2) Geolocation
Help needed from devs with Geolocation experience

3) Social network
Help needed to create system that maps connections, but respects privacy. Maybe just hashed phone number or something as an ID.

We want to help generate data so that researchers can learn from the data real time (while respecting privacy).

## Looking for:
Engineering: 
React Developers
React Native Developers 
Medical Professionals
Health informatics professionals
Devs with experince using FHIR 
Epidimelogists
System biologists
Data scientists
Designers
UX/UI
Project managers

Translators: Korean, Chinese, Persian, Spanish, Portoguese, French, German, Russian, you name it.

And you.

Open up an issue. And lets try to stem this before it gets bigger than it is.
