# decentralized-electronic-health-record
A decentralized electronic health record. Get ahead of the virus by tracking symptoms, geolocation and social connections while protecting patient privacy.

## Goal:
The goal is to build a decentralized EHR that looks for symptoms of COVID-19 and helps with reducing the transmission rate.

## IPR- Initial Public Release
There will be three features
1) Symptom tracker that follows a specific medical protocol.   
Help needed from medical professionals.

2) Geolocation  
Help needed from devs with Geolocation experience

3) Social network  
Help needed to create a system that maps connections, but respects privacy. Maybe just hashed phone number or something as an ID.

We want to help generate data so that researchers can learn from the data real-time (while respecting privacy).

## Looking for:
React Developers
React Native Developers 
Medical Professionals
Health informatics professionals
Devs with experience using FHIR 
Epidemiologists
System biologists
Data scientists
Designers

Open up an [issue](https://github.com/COVID-19-electronic-health-system/decentralized-electronic-health-record/issues). And let's try to stem this before it gets more significant than it is.

## Progress:
As of March 12th, 2020:
Assembling team. 
See [organization members](https://github.com/orgs/COVID-19-electronic-health-system/people).

As of March 13th, 2020:  
Scoping out features for Initial Product release. 

Decided on Progressive Web App using React. 

Spoke with the maintainer of [Sundly](https://github.com/Sundly/sundly/issues/22), an EHR created on Blockstack. It has plenty of code. Willing to help and let us and let us use/maintain the code.

On March 13th, 2020, @6:30pm:
Will speak with Emergency room doctor and system architect with experience in medical workflows.


## Priorities:
**Ideally, we should be able to launch something by Monday afternoon (March 16th, 2020)**

As of March 13th, 2020:
1) The main priority is to narrow down features that experts will find useful. 

2) Then we can scope out features. Then create simple wireframes to build out front end. 

3) Then we can start to assign work and build.

4) Get a domain name and launch.
It should be sharable by text or WhatsApp.

Target is to have features scoped out by tonight. Start assigning features and work by Saturday morning.
